# Galactic Age Calculator

#### _By David Lewis_

## Description
_This is the Epicodus weekly project for week 1 of the JavaScript course. This application takes in a users age and calculates how old the user would be on Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter._

#### _Galactic Age Calculator_
* Takes in a users age in years and calculates how old they would be according to how long other planets' "years" when compared to earths rotation around the sun. These methods can also determine how many years you have left on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury according to the same planet year conversions. Life expectancy is set to be the average life expectancy of everyone human being on Earth. If you are past the life expectancy, the app can determine how many years on each planet you are past that age.
